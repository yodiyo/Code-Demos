### [Capture data from multiple APIs and output to Google Sheet](https://github.com/yodiyo/code-demos/tree/main/data-crunching)

Create API endpoints for all post types to output count
* The totals endpoint returns the totals of pages generated from posts, amp posts, pages, taxonomy terms, and authors with posts.
* The response includes counts for blog posts, amp posts, pages, glossary posts, categories, tags, custom taxonomies, and authors, and further granular counts and details for posts, taxonomies and authors.
  
The data is then captured and output to a Google Sheet spreadsheet using Google Scripts to loop through each subsite API
